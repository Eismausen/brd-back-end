# BRD&GM

This is going to be the back end for the BRD&GM webapp. 

The intention is that this will operate as an intuitive, feature-rich, single page web app to handle all of the inventory needs of the burgeoning board game enthusiast. This is built on top of the Board Game Atlas API (https://www.boardgameatlas.com/api/docs). More details to come!
